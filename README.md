Project Description:

We need to get data. We'll use a sample data set for that.The raw data is completely infused in the workspace. The entries includes location,frequency and status. Preprocessing is done before the analyzing part. The data must be clean so that the model can analyze correctly. For that the rows with empty values are removed. A module is added for that process. Individual measurable properties are called features. Each row is representing an automobile and each column represents the income of the person. The model is build accordingly. Now that the data is ready, constructing a predictive model consists of training and testing. We'll use our data to train the model, and then we'll test the model to see how closely it's able to predict availability of the individual blood banks.

I have developed using Azure Machine Learning Classic.
